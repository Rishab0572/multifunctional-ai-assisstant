Lung cancer is caused by smoking and air pollution.
Early symptoms include persistent cough and chest pain.
Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are common treatments.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, accounting for approximately 1.8 million deaths annually.
There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
NSCLC makes up about 85% of all lung cancer cases, while SCLC accounts for the remaining 15%.
Tobacco smoking is responsible for about 80-90% of lung cancer cases, making it the primary risk factor.
Second-hand smoke exposure increases lung cancer risk by 20-30% in non-smokers.
Radon gas exposure is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.
Occupational exposures to carcinogens like asbestos, arsenic, and diesel exhaust are significant risk factors.
Common symptoms of lung cancer include persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, hoarseness, and weight loss.
Advanced symptoms may include bone pain, headaches, and neurological problems if cancer spreads to other organs.
Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, can be a concerning symptom that requires immediate medical attention.
Lung cancer is often diagnosed using imaging tests like chest X-rays, CT scans, or PET scans.
Biopsy procedures are required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of lung cancer.
Stage I lung cancer is localized and has not spread to lymph nodes or distant organs.
Stage II lung cancer may involve nearby lymph nodes but has not metastasized to distant sites.
Stage III lung cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or to nearby structures.
Stage IV lung cancer has metastasized to distant organs like the brain, bones, liver, or other lung areas.
Surgery is the preferred treatment for early-stage lung cancer when patients are eligible.
Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells and can be used alone or with other treatments.
Chemotherapy drugs are used to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells throughout the body.
Targeted therapy drugs attack specific genetic mutations found in some lung cancers, like EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 alterations.
Immunotherapy helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells, often by targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathways.
Five-year survival rates vary from 60% for localized lung cancer to 6% for metastatic disease.
Smoking cessation is the most effective way to prevent lung cancer, reducing risk gradually over time.
Screening with low-dose CT scans is recommended for high-risk individuals between ages 50-80 with significant smoking history.
Genetic factors may influence lung cancer risk, even in never-smokers.
Air pollution is linked to approximately 1 in 10 lung cancer cases globally.
Lung cancer often has no symptoms until it has spread, making early detection challenging.
Palliative care focuses on improving quality of life and managing symptoms for advanced lung cancer patients.
Clinical trials offer access to experimental treatments and are essential for advancing lung cancer therapy.
Biomarker testing helps identify specific genetic alterations that can guide treatment decisions.
Liquid biopsies can detect cancer DNA in blood samples and may help monitor treatment response.
Survivorship care plans are important for lung cancer patients who complete treatment.
Pulmonary rehabilitation can help improve breathing and quality of life after lung cancer treatment.
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivers precise, high-dose radiation to small tumors.
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive surgical technique for lung cancer.
Pneumonectomy involves removing an entire lung and is sometimes necessary for extensive disease.
Lobectomy, or removal of a lung lobe, is the most common surgery for lung cancer.
Wedge resection removes the tumor and a small amount of surrounding tissue.
Small cell lung cancer typically responds well to chemotherapy initially but often recurs.
Paraneoplastic syndromes can cause symptoms unrelated to the physical effects of the tumor.
Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a neuromuscular disorder that can occur with small cell lung cancer.
SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) can cause low sodium levels in lung cancer patients.
Cushing's syndrome can develop from hormones produced by some lung tumors.
Maintenance therapy may help extend remission in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Cachexia, or wasting syndrome, is common in advanced lung cancer and affects quality of life.
Bronchoscopy allows doctors to look inside the airways and collect tissue samples.
Mediastinoscopy examines lymph nodes in the chest to determine if cancer has spread.
Thoracentesis may be performed to drain fluid from around the lungs and test for cancer cells.
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) helps locate and biopsy lymph nodes near the airways.
Molecular testing identifies specific mutations and helps guide precision medicine approaches.
Next-generation sequencing can identify numerous genetic alterations in a single test.
Tumor mutational burden measures the number of mutations and may predict immunotherapy response.
PD-L1 expression testing helps determine if a patient may benefit from certain immunotherapies.
Lung cancer research focuses on early detection, targeted therapies, and improving survival rates.
Support groups provide emotional support and practical advice for lung cancer patients and families.
Financial toxicity refers to the economic burden of lung cancer treatment on patients.
